# Medical Imaging: A survey towards better algorithms

## About
This is an implementation of the paper [_'A survey on attention mechanisms for medical applications: are we moving towards better algorithms?'_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9889720). 

## Abstract
The paper extensively reviews the use of attention mechanisms in machine learning (including Transformers) for several medical applications, and proposes a critical analysis of the claims and potentialities of attention mechanisms presented in the literature through an experimental case study on medical image classification with three different use cases.
